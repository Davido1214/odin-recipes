        Easy to make and bake Coffee Cake Recipe! First start with 1/3 cups vegetable oil and 2/3 cups water. Then add 1 large egg and slowly mix in 2 cups of flower or your premade ready mix flower and whisk together until properly mixed. Finally oil up a 9 inch pan and spoon half your cake mix in evenly, then you will want to generously spread your grounded cinnamon on top and spoon the rest of your cake mix on top of that with more grouned cinnamon on top of that! Once your cake is ready for the oven, slap it in at 400 degrees fahrenheit for 35-41 minutes, let sit for at least 5 minutes and enjoy!
